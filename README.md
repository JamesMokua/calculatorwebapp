## How I worked on this project
My goal was to simulate a professional work environment:
- I built this app based on my own UI designs.
- I worked with tasks on my personal to do list that i created.
## How to navigate on this project
The application uses Math JS library and Material UI for styling.
## Why I built the project this way
I didn't use state management library such as Redux on purpose. For this app simple ```useState``` is sufficient.\
Material UI is a great library for styling when using React and provides styling for various components.
## If I had more time i would change this
- Create more precise commits
- Create branches and use pull requests to generate a good workflow
- Use Trello to handle my tasks during development
- Improve on the UI
- Add Scientific calculator functionality
## Available Scripts

$npm start
